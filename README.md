This project aims to harness the power of sentiment analysis, a subset of natural language processing (NLP), to monitor mental health through textual data. Sentiment analysis involves the use of algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify and extract subjective information from text, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. By applying sentiment analysis to text data from various sources, we can gain valuable insights into the emotional and mental states of individuals.
